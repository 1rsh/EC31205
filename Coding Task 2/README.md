### Scanpath Similarity Analysis:
**Problem Statement:**<br>
A scanpath refers to the sequence of eye movements made by an individual's eyes as they explore and visually process a visual stimulus, such as an image, scene, or text. These eye movements are characterized by fixations (brief periods when the eyes are relatively still and focused on a specific point) and saccades (rapid movements of the eyes between fixations).<br><br>
The dataset contains information about the scanpaths of multiple individuals as they interact with stimulus images.<br><br>

**The Code:**<br>
**Refer [Scanpath Similarity Analysis.ipynb](/Coding%20Task%202/Scanpath%20Similarity%20Analysis.ipynb).<br>
Edit Distance between Scanpaths was computed and a Minimum Spanning Tree was constructed using Prim's Algorithm, the edge with the largest weight was then removed. This yielded two clusters of individuals.
<br><br>
**Results:**<br>
The program provides a graph output with two clusters.<br>
